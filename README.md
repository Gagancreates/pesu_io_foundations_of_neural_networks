# Foundations of Neural Networks and Deep Learning

Welcome to the **Foundations of Neural Networks and Deep Learning** course!  
This repository is your go-to resource for all the materials, code, and assignments for our **intensive 30-hour course**.

We'll be going on a journey from **traditional machine learning** to **modern deep learning**, with a focus on practical, hands-on implementation.  
By the end of this course, you'll have built a **complete, end-to-end deep learning pipeline** for the MNIST digit classification task.

## Course Phases

The course is split into **three main phases**:

### **Phase 1: Math and ML Foundations (Days 1–5)**  
- Quick refresher on **Python**, **NumPy**, and basic math.  
- Dive into traditional ML models like **Linear Regression** and **Logistic Regression** to build a strong baseline intuition.

### **Phase 2: Neural Networks (FCNNs) (Days 6–9)**  
- Introduction to the **core concepts of neural networks**.  
- Build a **fully connected neural network (FCNN)** from scratch using **NumPy**, and then implement the same with **PyTorch** to understand the differences.

### **Phase 3: CNNs + Capstone (Days 10–12)**  
- Learn **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for image-based tasks.  
- Explore **regularization techniques** like *dropout* and *batch normalization*.  
- **Final Project**: Build a complete MNIST deep learning pipeline to showcase everything you've learned.
